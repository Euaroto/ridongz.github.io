I am a researcher focusing on **interpretability and reliability of large language models (LLMs)**.

My research investigates **how internal representations—such as hidden states, attention patterns, and logits—encode reasoning, confidence, and failure modes in LLMs**, with the goal of building **faithful, reliable, and transparent language models**.

## Research Interests

- Mechanistic interpretability of large language models  
- Hidden state and layer-wise representation analysis  
- Faithfulness and causal analysis of LLM explanations  
- Confidence and uncertainty estimation in LLMs  
- Interpretability for LLM safety and robustness
